# Introduction to custom functions

# The examples functions have been made to replicate the base R sum() function and are therefore
# for illustrative purposes only.

# R has many base functions and thousands of packages which can handle most of the tasks you will need to
# carry out. However, there are instances that you will need to make your own functions.


# basic function syntax
function(arg1, arg2){
  someprocess
  return(output)
}


# custom function to add two elements together





# There are many situations where you want to carry out an operation on a vector of variable lengths
# For example we might want to add the vector elements together without knowing how long our vector is










# ellipsis used to supply non-hard coded arguments









# using sum function, include arg to substract if desired
