# here are two samples from a fake RNAseq dataset
testdata <- readRDS("test_data/fakeRNAseq_week2.RDS")[1:2]

# for this example I have replaced gene names with ensembl IDs to keep them unique
# the data is stored as a list of dataframes
# REMEMBER - individual elements of a LIST can be accessed using the double brackets data[[1]]

# task 1: check whether ALL of the ensembl IDs in the first dataframe are present in the second

# task 2: 'intersect' the two dataframes to see which ensembl IDs are shared

# task 3: use the vector of shared genes to subset both dataframes

# task 4: use the 'order' function to re-order the second dataframe, based on the order of geneIDs in the first
# HINT - look back at week 1 to see how to re-order a dataframe

# task 5: now that your dataframes are in the same order combine the two dataframes into one


### Sami - below 'testdata' is a list with 7 samples instead of 2
# task 6: try to make for loops to carry out these tasks on all 7 samples rather than just 2.
# some of this might be quite hard! so dont worry if you get stuck. feel free to drop me a message and 
# I can give you some clues
